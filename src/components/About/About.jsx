Iâ€™ve been dabbling in web design and front-end work since I was 13, pouring hours of my time into pimping out me and my friends' Myspaces. I was passionate about imagining a layout and experimenting to execute the vision I had for each page design. During my time in university, I pursued my other passion for psychology, namely behavior change and the ability one has to change their lives through their health and habits. After over 7 years in the industry, I reconnected with my love for innovative engineering by taking a leap and devoting my time to building upon my programming skills. I am currently focused on Javascript and React. I'm a go-getter and always hungry to learn."}
