I found myself pouring hours into pimping out my Myspace with HTML and Adobe Photoshop, eventually offering my time to customize my friend's pages. Experimenting to execute the vision I had for each page design was a hobby I found myself losing time engaging in. During my university years, I pursued my other passion for psychology, namely behavior change and the ability one is able to change their lives through their health and habits. After over 7 years in the industry, I reconnected with my love for innovative engineering by taking a leap and devoting my time to building upon my programming skills. I am currently focused on Python, Javascript, React, and Flask. I'm a go-getter and always hungry to learn."}
